**jsrepo.com** is a centralized source registry for registries. Much like npm is for packages, **jsrepo.com** is for registries.

**jsrepo.com** comes with a few added benefits over other registry providers:

-   Semver support
-   First class support for private registries with the `jsrepo auth` command
-   Discoverability of your registry through the **jsrepo.com** website (also by the jsrepo mcp agent)
-   Easier installation for your users with simple `@<scope>/<registry>` syntax

## Usage

To start adding registry items from **jsrepo.com** you can run the following command:

```sh
jsrepo add @<scope>/<registry>
```

You can also add registries at a specific version:

```sh
jsrepo add @<scope>/<registry>@1.0.0
```

## Authentication

To authenticate with jsrepo.com you can run the following command:

```sh
jsrepo auth jsrepo
```

Once authenticated you will have access to all registries associated with your account public and private as well as the ability to publish registries.

You can logout of your account by running:

```sh
jsrepo auth jsrepo --logout
```

### Environment Variable

If you prefer to use an environment variable or are in an environment where you can't use the `jsrepo auth` command you can provide the token via the `JSREPO_TOKEN` environment variable.

```sh
JSREPO_TOKEN=... jsrepo publish 
```

## Publishing your registry to jsrepo.com

Once you have authenticated you can publish your registry with the `publish` command:

```sh
jsrepo publish
```

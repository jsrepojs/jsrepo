[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) proved that distributing code in a way that allows consumers to own the source is an extremely powerful pattern. Since then registries have become a common way to distribute reusable components.

As more and more registries start to emerge it became clear that there was a need for a more powerful toolchain to help manage and distribute these registries. That's where **jsrepo** comes in...

**jsrepo** is a toolchain for distributing your code. It gives powerful tools to both registry owners and consumers. 

**Registry owners...**
- Don't want to have to write their own CLI and build system to distribute their code
- Want to be able to test and verify that their registry will work for their users before they publish it
- Want to be able to host their registries privately without having to write their own hosting solution

**Registry consumers...**
- Want to quickly add items from a registry to their project and start using them without having to even look at the code
- Want to be able to easily update their items with visibility to what as changed
- Want to be able to install and manage code from multiple registries in a single project
- Want an easy way to authenticate to private registries

**jsrepo...**
- Provides a powerful CLI for building and distributing your registry
- Prevents you from publishing broken or unusable registries
- Provides provider adapters to allow you to host your registry publicly or privately anywhere you want
- Automatically resolves dependencies to other items so your items always come ready to use
- Provides an interactive update command to easily update your items with visibility to what as changed
- Allows you to authenticate to private registries with `jsrepo auth`

		<AccordionTrigger>Is this trying to replace npm?</AccordionTrigger>
		<AccordionContent className="flex flex-col gap-4 text-balance">
			No, **jsrepo** won't replace npm, but it's perfect for distributing code like leftPad that probably shouldn't
			be a package but also shouldn't have to be rewritten every time.

		<AccordionTrigger>Is this shadcn compatible?</AccordionTrigger>
		<AccordionContent className="flex flex-col gap-4 text-balance">
			Yes **jsrepo** is not shadcn compatible. You can add and update items from **shadcn** with zero configuration needed.

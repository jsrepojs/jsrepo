> shadcn, but for everyone 😄

**jsrepo** is a language agnostic CLI for distributing code. [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) proved that distributing code in a way that allows consumers to own the source is an extremely powerful pattern, **jsrepo** helps more people adopt this pattern by making it incredibly easy to distribute code from any language and source.

		<AccordionTrigger>Is this trying to replace npm?</AccordionTrigger>
		<AccordionContent className="flex flex-col gap-4 text-balance">
			No, **jsrepo** won't replace npm but is perfect for distributing code like leftPad that probably shouldn't
			be a package but you also shouldn't have to rewrite every time.

			**jsrepo** is language agnostic and is built to handle multiple registries in the same project. You also
			aren't limited to just distributing your code from your own website you can also distribute it from most major git
			providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc).

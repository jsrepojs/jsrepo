The [@jsrepo/transform-change-case](https://npmjs.com/package/@jsrepo/transform-change-case) package is a transform plugin for **jsrepo** that transforms file names to different case formats before adding them to your project.

<Callout type="info">
    This is useful when your project follows a specific file naming convention and you want registry items to automatically conform to it.
</Callout>

## Installation

To add the **@jsrepo/transform-change-case** transform to your config run the following command:

```sh
jsrepo config transform change-case
```

This will automatically install the transform and add it to your config:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "jsrepo";
import changeCase from "@jsrepo/transform-change-case"; // [!code ++]

export default defineConfig({
	transforms: [changeCase({ to: "camel" })], // [!code ++]
});
```

Now when a file is added to your project it will be transformed to the target case format:

```ts title="utils/my-helper.ts → utils/myHelper.ts"
export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
	return a + b;
}
```

## Configuration

The transform accepts an options object with the following property:

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `to` | `"kebab" \| "camel" \| "snake" \| "pascal"` | The target case format for file names |

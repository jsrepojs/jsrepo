The [@jsrepo/transform-prettier](https://npmjs.com/package/@jsrepo/transform-prettier) package is a transform plugin for **jsrepo** that formats code using your local Prettier configuration before it's added to your project using [Prettier](https://prettier.io).

<Callout type="info">
    This is especially useful when you are making use of the `jsrepo update` command as it will format the code the same way as it is in your project preventing any formatting changes from being shown in the diff.

## Installation

To add the **@jsrepo/transform-prettier** transform to your config run the following command:

```sh
jsrepo config transform prettier
```

This will automatically install the transform and add it to your config:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "jsrepo";
import prettier from "@jsrepo/transform-prettier"; // [!code ++]

export default defineConfig({
	transforms: [prettier()], // [!code ++]
});
```

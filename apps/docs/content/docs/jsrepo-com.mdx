[jsrepo.com](https://jsrepo.com) is a centralized source registry for registries. Much like npm is for packages, **jsrepo.com** is for registries.

Like npm you publish your registry to [jsrepo.com](https://jsrepo.com) with the `jsrepo publish` command and then other developers can add your code to their projects with the `jsrepo add` command.

## The benefits of jsrepo.com

- Semver support - You can publish multiple versions of the same registry (including pre-release versions) just like you would on npm.
- Easy installation - You can add your registry to your project with the simple `@<scope>/<registry>` syntax.
- Private registries - You can easily publish private registries and share them with your team for free.
- Marketplace - You can monetize your registry by selling it on the marketplace.

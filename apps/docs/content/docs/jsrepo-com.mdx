description: A registry for your registries.
---

[jsrepo.com](https://jsrepo.com) is a centralized source registry for registries. Much like npm is for packages, **jsrepo.com** is for registries.

Like npm, you publish your registry to [jsrepo.com](https://jsrepo.com) with the `jsrepo publish` command and then other developers can add your code to their projects with the `jsrepo add` command.

## The benefits of jsrepo.com

- Semver support - You can publish multiple versions of the same registry (including pre-release versions) just like you would on npm.
- Easy installation - You can add your registry to your project with the simple `@<scope>/<registry>` syntax.
- Private registries - You can easily publish private registries and share them with your team for free.
- Marketplace - You can monetize your registry by selling it on the marketplace.

## Publishing your registry

If you already have a registry that can be built with **jsrepo** then there are only a few steps to publishing it to **jsrepo.com**. If not then checkout the [create a registry](/docs/create-a-registry) guide to get started.

<Steps>

<Step>
    ### Create an account
    Go to [jsrepo.com](https://jsrepo.com) and create an account.
</Step>

<Step>
    ### Claim a scope
    Once you have an account navigate to `/account/scopes/new` to [claim a scope](https://www.jsrepo.com/account/scopes/new). 
    
    Scopes are used to group your registries together and are required to publish your registry.

    When users add your registry the scope will be the first part of the registry name: `@<scope>/<registry>`.
</Step>

<Step>
    ### Authenticate with jsrepo.com
    Run the following command to authenticate with jsrepo.com:

    ```sh
    jsrepo auth jsrepo
    ```

    You will be prompted to finish the sign in in your browser and then you will be authenticated.
</Step>

<Step>
    ### Prepare your registry
    Decide on a name for your registry and add it to your `jsrepo.config.ts` file:

    ```ts title="jsrepo.config.ts"
    import { defineConfig } from "jsrepo";

    export default defineConfig({
        registry: {
            name: "@my-scope/my-registry", // [!code ++]
            // ...
        },
    });
    ```

    Next you need to provide the version or your registry that will be published. If you want **jsrepo** to pull from the version in your `package.json` file just provide `package` as the version:

    ```ts title="jsrepo.config.ts"
    import { defineConfig } from "jsrepo";

    export default defineConfig({
        registry: {
            name: "@my-scope/my-registry",
            version: "1.0.0", // [!code ++]
            // or take the version from the `package.json` file
            version: "package", // [!code ++]
            // ...
        },
    });
    ```

    (Optional) Now is also a good time to add any other metadata you want to your registry:

    ```ts title="jsrepo.config.ts"
    import { defineConfig } from "jsrepo";

    export default defineConfig({
        registry: {
            name: "@my-scope/my-registry",
            description: "My first registry", // [!code ++]
            homepage: "https://my-registry.com", // [!code ++]
            repository: "https://github.com/my-scope/my-registry", // [!code ++]
            bugs: "https://github.com/my-scope/my-registry/issues", // [!code ++]
            authors: ["Aidan Bleser"], // [!code ++]
            tags: ["first-registry"], // [!code ++]
            // ...
        },
    });
    ```

    (Optional) By default your registry will be published as public so anyone can see and use it. You can change the access level to `"private"` or `"marketplace"` by setting the `access` property:

    ```ts title="jsrepo.config.ts"
    import { defineConfig } from "jsrepo";

    export default defineConfig({
        registry: {
            name: "@my-scope/my-registry",
            access: "private", // [!code ++]
        },
    });
    ```
</Step>

<Step>
    ### Publish your registry
    Run the following command to publish your registry:

    ```sh
    jsrepo publish
    ```
</Step>

<Step>
    ### Start adding items to your project
    Run the following command to add items to your project:

    ```sh
    jsrepo add --registry @my-scope/my-registry
    # or 
    jsrepo init @my-scope/my-registry
    ```
</Step>

</Steps>

The `vue` language plugin supports dependency resolution for Vue files as well as installing remote dependencies with `ecosystem: "js"`.

<Callout type="warning">
	This language plugin requires `vue` to be installed in your project.
</Callout>

## Supported syntax

The Vue plugin parses all script tags and passes the code to the [JavaScript plugin](/docs/languages/js) to resolve dependencies so all the same syntax is supported.

## Supported File Extensions

The Vue language plugin supports the following file extensions:

| Extension |
| --------- |
| `.vue`    |

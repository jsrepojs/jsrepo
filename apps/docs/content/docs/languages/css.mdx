The `css` language plugin supports dependency resolution for CSS, SCSS, and Sass files as well as installing remote dependencies with `ecosystem: "js"`.

## Supported syntax

The CSS plugin uses the [css-dependency](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-dependency) library under the hood to detect dependencies. So it supports all the following syntax:

-   `@import` statements
-   `@plugin` statements (if `allowTailwindDirectives` is `true`)
-   `@config` statements (if `allowTailwindDirectives` is `true`)
-   `@reference` statements (if `allowTailwindDirectives` is `true`)

By default `allowTailwindDirectives` is `true` so it will also detect Tailwind directives as imports. To opt out of this behavior you can set `allowTailwindDirectives` to `false`.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "jsrepo";
import { css } from "jsrepo/langs";

export default defineConfig({
	languages: [css({ allowTailwindDirectives: false })], // [!code ++]
});
```
## Supported File Extensions

The CSS language plugin supports the following file extensions:

| Extension |
| --------- |
| `.css`    |
| `.scss`   |
| `.sass`   |

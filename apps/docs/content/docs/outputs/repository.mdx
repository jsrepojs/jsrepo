The `repository` output is used when you are serving your registry from a repository and want to minimize code duplication and tracked files.

## Usage

```ts title="jsrepo.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "jsrepo";
import { repository } from "jsrepo/outputs"; // [!code ++]

export default defineConfig({
	registry: {
		outputs: [repository()], // [!code ++]
	},
});
```

Now running `jsrepo build` will output a `registry.json` file to the root of your repository.

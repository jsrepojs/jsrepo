The `@jsrepo/shadcn` is a package that helps you distribute your jsrepo registry as a shadcn registry.

## Usage

To get started install the package:

```npm
npm install @jsrepo/shadcn -D
```

Next let's add the output to our config file:

```ts title="jsrepo.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "jsrepo";
import { output } from "@jsrepo/shadcn/output";

export default defineConfig({
	registry: {
        // ...
		outputs: [output({ dir: "./public/r/shadcn" })], // [!code ++]
	},
});
```

Now running `jsrepo build` will output a **shadcn** registry to the `./public/r/shadcn` directory.

## defineShadcnRegistry

**shadcn** registries are defined a bit differently than **jsrepo** registries, generally this plugin should correctly resolve those differences or warn you if it is unable to. 

However if you are only distributing your registry as a **shadcn** registry and don't care about the other features of **jsrepo** you can use the `defineShadcnRegistry` function to define your registry the *"shadcn"* way.

```ts title="jsrepo.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "jsrepo";
import { defineShadcnRegistry, output } from "@jsrepo/shadcn";

export default defineConfig({
	registry: defineShadcnRegistry({
		// make sure you still include the output
		outputs: [output({ dir: "./public/r/shadcn" })],
	}),
});
```

<Callout type="info">
    When using the `defineShadcnRegistry` function it's be possible to just paste the contents of the **shadcn** `registry.json` file into your config file and start building your registry with **jsrepo**.
</Callout>

## Outputting jsrepo registries alongside shadcn registries

Currently the **jsrepo** and **shadcn** outputs are not compatible to be used in the same directory. Because of this you will need to serve each registry from a different URL.

The preferred way to avoid this conflict would be to publish your registry to [jsrepo.com](https://jsrepo.com) (which also has it's own benefits).

In absence of that, the easiest way to do this and our recommendation is to postfix the **shadcn** registry output `dir` option with `/shadcn`.

For example:

```ts title="jsrepo.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "jsrepo";
import { distributed } from "jsrepo/outputs";
import { output } from "@jsrepo/shadcn/output";

export default defineConfig({
	registry: {
		outputs: [
            distributed({ dir: "./public/r" }), 
            output({ dir: "./public/r" }) // [!code --]
            output({ dir: "./public/r/shadcn" }) // [!code ++]
        ],
	},
});
```
